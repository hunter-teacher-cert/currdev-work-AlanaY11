## New Course: Game Design-Animated Art Using p4.js (Grades 6-8 Special Education)

This course would be an **introductory game design and/or animated art course using p5.js.** This course would fit within the curriculum scope and sequence where **students would have already taken Scratch, Google’s Scratch CSFirst or a unit in Code.Or’gs Computer Science Discoveries (CSD) course**. 
1. It would target middle school students. 
2. It would be a spring course 
3. It would be after students have been introduced to either:
4. Scratch,
5. A unit in Code.Org’s CSD course - Web Development,
6. A unit in Code.Org's CSD course - Interactive Animations & Games using the Game Lab,
7. A unit in Code.Org's CSD course - The Design Process using the App Lab

The p5 editor offers students’ an immediate visual of their code. Additionally, p5.js is an introductory text-based language for students who are starting to learn a text-based language. 

In 2020 I tried to teach p5.js to my students but this was before the universal DOE rollout of student-issued emails and then the Pandemic hit so I was never able to fully implement the course. Now that students have DOE-issued emails and they have gained some digital fluency and practice in signing into and out of accounts, I think this strategy helps reduce the frustration and cognitive overload in my neurodiverse students. Additionally, I would also do a crash course in typing that specifically targets the special characters and the top and bottom rows so they are familiar with the characters in p5.js editor. P5.js is an engaging programming language that allows students to create digital sketches and then animate them and there is a high degree of interest in art, game design and animation among my students.
