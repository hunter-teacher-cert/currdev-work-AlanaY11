# Compare Curriculum

#### (Alternatively: Elementary school teachers that cannot find anything similar to compare to, or masters students, may opt to compare two of the APCSP curricula that were linked in the Async portion of the assignment.)

### *Curriculum Similarities and Differences* 
Both UTeach Computer Science and CS Matters focus on the Collge Board's Computer Science Principles (CSP) curriculum framework. They both cover the same big ideas, topics, and units. Hoever, their approach to implemention and their projects and CS themes are dramatically different. UTeach is heavily focused on programming without the context of why you are learning this program and why it matters or what is it's connection and importance to real-world scenarios. CS Matters address the why you learn CS and prompts students to be analytical of computing artifacts and ethics in computing. The curriculum is more engaging, interesting, and student-focused.

### *Curriculum Strengths and Weakness*
CS Matters is a stonger curriculum because it is more accessible based on the themes and the student-focused activities. U Teach Computer Science is simply boring because it emphasizes programming abstract games without a connection to real-world scenarios and student-choice and voice.

## *Curriculum Differences*
### *U Teach Computer Science* 
The U Teach Computer Science is a curriculum that addresses the College Board's AP Computer Science Principles Framework.  
1. The curriculum is very light on details
2. There are no example activities
3. It is not student-focused 
4. Although the curriculum is project-based the projects do not seem as engaging and student-focused.
5. There are n

1. Includes sample assignments
2. Accessible - many entry points for new CS educators and for students
3. More detailed
4. Includes unplugged sample activities
5. More student-interest focused
6. The projects are thematically focused on students' interest
7. The projects demonstrate how CS can be used to address a problem of interest to them or in their community.
8. The lesssonss and projects have a theme of ethics in CS and prompts students to think of the ethical implications of CS inventions and artifacts and its and through a social justice lens.

## *Curriculum Adaptations*
### Would you adapt anything from the curriculum you do not teach in your class if you could? Why?
As a elementarary and middle school special education CS teacher, I would adapt several units from CS Matters for my 6-8 grade students. I would adapt your virtual world unit because based on the samle lesson it prompts students to reflect on the "Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics".  Ethics in computer science is too ofter overlooked and students think technology is neutral, when it is not.  I would also adapt alot the Data Manipulation Unit and Data Acquisition. Data is the core of computer science and living a technological world our students need to know, be critical, and analyze how their is used, collected, and manipulated.
