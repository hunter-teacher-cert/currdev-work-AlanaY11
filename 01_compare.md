# Compare Curriculum

#### (Alternatively: Elementary school teachers that cannot find anything similar to compare to, or masters students, may opt to compare two of the APCSP curricula that were linked in the Async portion of the assignment.)

Focus on the following:
Major differences
Major similiarities
Comparative streangths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem euqlly good then no need to comment).
Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?
