Desribe 2 technological tools you currently use in your classroom. One of which should be a programming tool (if possible). 
Include:
The name of the tool. What its general purpose is. The class(es) you use it in. How you use it in class. Why you have selected that tool for that purpose?


The two technological tools I currently use in my class are [Tynker.Com](https://www.tynker.com/) and ## [Seesaw](https://web.seesaw.me/).  Tynker is a programming tool and an IDE and Seesaw is an engagement and Learning Management tool. 

****Tynker is a web-based platform for programming, logic, and STEM for K-12th grade with both scratch-based blocks and text-based programming (i.e. Javascript, Python, Java, Swift, and HTML) and a Minecraft lite feature that allows students to create minecraft skins, blocks, and mods and remix others minecrafts artifacts from the Tynker community.

There is also an app-based (iOS and Android) Tynker for K-2nd grade. Tynker has both free and paid plans. I use the free web-based Tynker for my K-8th grade classes in both my alternate assessment Autistic class and my standard assessment classses (students/classes that take the NYState Exams). I begin with the block-based logic and puzzle based lessons, then progress to the creative block-based lessons and for the challenge level and students who are interested I introduce them to some text-based modules in Python. Tynker allows students to toggle back and forth between block-based and text-based so I always show this feature to my upper elementary classes. The hit with Tynker is the Minecraft-lite feature which offers students the opportunity to create Minecraft blocks, skins, and mods or remix ones that are in the Tynker community. My students LOVE Tynker and even ask for their accounts from previous years. 

****Seesaw is an engagement tool and can be used as a learning management system. 

It offers tons of accessible features to capture student learning and progress as well as ways to present your lessons. It is easy for students to log into their accounts since they use QR codes and not emails. Emails is a barrier for my students due to the text-number combination and the length of the DOE student email makes my students prone to errors, especially for students with dyslexia. 

Seesaw allows students to log into their account with a QR code or a text code. I generally use the QR code because it is more accessible and easier sign in than a text code. I prefer Seesaw more, especially for my K-2nd grade classes and my Alternate Assessment Autistic classes. It’s multimedia learning tool allows students to demonstrate their progress in many formats. Seesaw is a great engagement tool that teachers can use to present their lessons. I use Seesaw to present my lessons as well as the lessons in the Seesaw library. It is a great tool to assess my students learning in an accessible way. Students responses can be captured by writing, drawing, students can audio record themselves, video record their answers or though process or solving a problem, or add pictures or vidoes to their answers. Once students’ answers are uploaded teachers can track their assignment completion and map the assignments to standards.
