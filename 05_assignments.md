## Assignments 

### Assignment One: A.I. and Machine Learning - Training an A.I. Bot named Zhorai 
[(Lesson Adapted from MIT's AI RAISE Curriculum)](https://raise.mit.edu/resources.html)

*How can an A.I. learn through interaction?*

Students will be able to:
>> - Interact with a conversational agent
>> - Identify what AI can learn
>> - Brainstorm implications of bias in AI

Intro/Warm up Discussion: 
>> - How do you think Alexa, Siri, Google, Cortana work? 
>> - Can they learn new things? 
>> - Can we teach them new things? 

>Today we're going to talk to an alien A.I. Bot whose name is Zhorai. Each of you are going to go through all four modules and interact with Zhourai and witness it's learning.

### Assignment Two: What AI Does Well and Does Not Do as Well 

![A I isNot giphy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17364335/196577399-4cecc627-de90-405e-a8bf-79429f6c19c9.gif)

[Adapted from Hands-on AI Projects for the Classroom K-5 ISTE Guide Unplugged Activities]

 At the end of this project, students will be able to:
• Identify types of tasks AI does well and explain how they know this.
• Identify types of tasks AI does not do well and explain how they know this.
• Understand that an AI is a computer program.

Watch the video ### [WHAT'S INTELLIGENT ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR6j9TLZdAw)**

Then Explore the Examples of A.I. Tasks in Action - what does the A.I. do well?
Point out to students that usually A.I.s can do only one specific task well.

 [Activity: Aaron Wong AI Tic-Tac-Toe](https://www.aaronccwong.com/tic-tac-toe)
 
 [Activity: Google Quick Draw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/)


Students work in pairs to explore the two A.I. activities. They then discuss with their partner and answer the following prompts:
1.  what makes these activities A.I.?
2.  what did the A.I. do well in these activities?
3.  was the A.I. fast?
4.  what things or tasks you think A.I. can do?
5.  what things or tasks you think A.I. can't do?
