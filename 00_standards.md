# Standards: Cybersecurity (Safeguards & Risks) and Digital Literacy (Digital Citizenship)

###### (Pick 2 specific NY CS standards and describe a lesson/task/assignment that addresses your   selected standards, explain how)

###  Standards 
The New York State **Cybersecurity (safeguards & risks)** and **Digital Literacy (digital citizenship)** standards are a crucial part of the computer science curriculum and both are foundational to developing ethical and responsible citizens. Although these standards are different, they can be addressed in the same lesson. They build on each other. I generally teach lessons that address these standards and I usually start with digital literacy and then cybersecurity. For example, a lesson that I would teach would focus on the **ethics of computing** as what is the right and wrong (unethical) use of computing, **password protection, social engineering and network security.
 
 ### Sample Tasks & Assignments
I would share the type of password a family member created and ask students to assess whether it meets the criteria for a strong password based on our lesson. We then **discuss news topics and articles** that address the issue. Finally, students use **logic and problem-solving** in a **game-based assessment** to test their skill in developing a strong password.  This is the lesson format I use to teach these topics where first I either directly teach about the topic or hook students with a news article or video about the topics and then students are assessed using various **game-based assessments** or **real-world simulations. 

Finally, lessons on **social engineering** are generally **the most engaged and vigorously discussed topic** because students push back on safe digital practices and ways to identify phishing scams and how not to fall for them. These lessons help them develop a strong awareness about how to spot phishing scams, fake websites, and social media posts that attempt that to lure them into illegal actions online or in person.  Students are immersed in several scenarios through a game-based module where they need to use their critical thinking and problem solving skills. Students earn points and level up is they answer the questions and scenarios correctly and they lose points and are bumped down a level if they answer incorrectly.

### Why 
The ethics of computing addresses both digital citizenship and cybersecurity **because safeguards and risks in cybersecurity focuses on understanding why data and resources need to be protected and how to protect it** and **digital citizenship focuses on learners using computing tools in a positive way.** Password protection and network security highlights the importance of privacy, security settings and digital security and how to protect your data and computing tools from breaches and hackers.
