4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

+ Or pluses

# Standards: Cybersecurity (Safeguards & Risks) and Digital Literacy (Digital Citizenship)

###### (Pick 2 specific NY CS standards and describe a lesson/task/assignment that addresses your   selected standards, explain how)

### * Standards *
The New York State Cybersecurity (safeguards & risks) and Digital Literacy (digital citizenship) standards are a crucial part of the computer science curriculum and both are foundational to developing ethical and responsible citizens. Although these standards are different, they can be addressed in the same lesson. They build on each other.  I generally teach lessons that address these standards and I usually start with digital literacy and then cybersecurity. For example, a lesson that I would teach would focus on the ethics of computing as what is the right and wrong (unethical) use of computing, password protection, social engineering and network security.
 
 ### Sample Tasks & Assignments
I would share the type of password a family member created and ask students to assess whether it meets the criteria for a strong password based on our lesson. We then discuss news topics and articles that address the issue. Finally, students use logic and problem-solving in a game-based assessment to test their skill in developing a strong password.  This is the lesson format I use to teach these topics where first I either directly teach about the topic or hook students with a news article or video about the topics and then students are assessed using various game-based assessments or real-world simulations. Finally, lessons on social engineering are generally the most engaged and vigorously discussed topic because students push back on safe digital practices and ways to identify phishing scams and how not to fall for them. Students are immersed in several scenarios through a game-based module where they need to use their critical thinking and problem solving skills. Students earn points and level up is they answer the questions and scenarios correctly and they lose points and are bumped down a level if they answer incorrectly.
