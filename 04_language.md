###### Select one of the languages that were discussed in the breakout rooms that you feel would be a good fit for a course that you currently teach or would like to teach. (If it is reasonable, pick a language other than one you currently teach.)

###### Answer the following prompts:

### What is the course? (grade level, student experience)

A good fit for my students is an introductory art-based programming class. This class would be for my advanced 8th grade special education students or the advanced middle school special education students who express an interest in learning text-based programming and love art and animation. This would be an introductory course in text-based programming using an IDE. First, I would spend a tremendous amount (at least 2 weeks) of time in teaching them the flow of using the IDE or PDE or as Processing calls it the Processing Development Environment (PDE) and logging into their account. 

This will help to reduce their frustration and the tech barrier to learning this programming language. Second, I would also spend a couple of class periods reviewing and practicing in our typing account number-letter-number combinations, advanced characters on the keyboard (i.e. (), {}, /, ; + noLoop, 20, 200, etc.) and camelCase combinations. These are the keyboard combinations that will be frequently used in the Processing Programming Language. This course would be great for my students. They are advanced and motivated and they demonstrate some proficiency in moving between block-based like Scratch and Tynker to text-based courses.  

### What is the language? 
Processing Programming Language

### How does one write & run code in this language? 
You write the code using the Processing Developing Environment which is with a text editor for writing the code. The program is started by pressing the run button in the text editor. You run the code in an IDE environment. Your program is called a Sketch, like an artist’s sketch, and it is stored in a Sketchbook.  

### Rate the complexity of the syntax? 

Although Processing’s default programming language is Java other programming modes may be downloaded 

### Strengths

The flexibility and ability to create art, computational artifacts and animated art is an asset and makes learning the program more engaging, especially for neurodiverse students that I teach. 
How would you utlilize the strengths in the class? I would utilize this art-based feature of the program to motivate students to stick with learning the program when they get frustrated and use art samples 
 
### Weaknesses: How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class? 

I would start out teaching this course to my neurodiverse students by chunking the content and developing their syntax fluency and comfort. First students learn and practice the Processing Development Environment and practice signing into and out of their accounts. Second, students work on familarizing themselves with the most commonly used text and special characters in Processing using their Typing.Com account and practicing the advanced characters, alpha-numeric combinations, and camelCase words. Third, in pair programming, students will sign into the Processing PDE and would play a scavenger game where they find the various features and practice in IDE and practice the syntax.

### Why did you select this language for this class? 

The art and sketch component of this language would engage my students since many of them are artists and love art so this would be a great way to hook them into learning a text-based language.
